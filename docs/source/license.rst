**weblablib** is released under the `GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_. 

This means that:

 * If you use this library for creating your own remote laboratory, you **must** provide your source code under the same license. You must have done this by the time anyone uses your remote laboratory.
 * **However**, if you are not willing to make your laboratory available with this same license and with the code available, then `LabsLand <https://labsland.com>`_ uses a dual-licensing model for **weblablib**: if you want to keep your remote laboratory as closed source (or with other open source license), we can grant you a license for it. For universities, research centers, and makers, or for providers of the LabsLand network, we will be especially flexible and often offer free-of-charge licenses. In order to do this, `contact us <https://labsland.com>`_
